Description

Essay grading is a time consuming effort and is often double scored involving two human raters to ensure grading consistency. There is a need for fast, effective and affordable solutions for automated grading of student-written essays. Traditional automation approaches still require a significant human involvement for complex feature engineering to identyfy grammar correctness, text coherence, logical flow and time consuming implementations for these features with SVM, Random Forest et al.

With deep learning models (specifically BERT and CNN), we show the models learn to discriminate important features in the essays automatically, and come close to predicting the scores assigned by human rates. The project emplys NLP data augmentation techniques to expand the limited training samples dataset.
