    "__Introduction__ Automated Essay Scoring (AES) systems are targeted at both alleviating the workload of teachers and improving the feedback cycle in educational systems. AES systems have also\n",
    "seen adoption for several high-stakes assessment, e.g., the e-rater system which has been used for TOEFL and GRE examinations. A successful AES system brings about widespread benefits to society and the education industry. Traditionally, the task of AES has been regarded as a machine learning problem which learns to approximate the marking process with supervised learning. Decades of AES research follow the same traditional supervised text regression methods in which handcrafted features are constructed and subsequently passed into a machine learning based classifier. A wide assortment of features are commonly extracted from essays. Simple and intuitive features may include essay length, sentence length. On the other hand, intricate and complex features may also be extracted, e.g.., features such as grammar correctness , readability  and textual\n",
    "coherence. However, these handcrafted features are often painstakingly designed, require a lot of human involvement and usually require laborious implementation for every new feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project we will apply deep learning models to learn important features of the essay automatically, and compare the results with the state of art deep learning models."

    "__Dataset Description__: There are eight essay sets. Each of the sets of essays was generated from a single prompt. Selected essays range from an average length of 150 to 550 words per response.

The variability is intended to test the limits of your scoring engine's capabilities.\n",

    "So, data augmentation techniques can be effective with unbalanced classes or small sample sizes (which was the case here). However, caution is warranted when extrapolating/generalizing the results. Since data augmentation takes the same essay, and creates a variation, the models learn the variations. However with a new essay, the results may not improve as much. In such cases, the 2 papers listed show promising approaches to better understand the logical progression and semantic relatedness to the main prompt. "
